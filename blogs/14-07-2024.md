# Welcome!
The purpose of this blogging site is for me to post about stuff, related to tech, any new skill i learned, life updates, project updates etc..

I got this idea of building a blog when i found myself in a situation where i wanted to "mansplain" a method in programming but I wasn't provided enough space anywhere to do so. there are more sites dedicated to blogging, which might have been better to use in a long term, but I thought it was a good idea to build one from scratch, with React, a framework i haven't used in around 2 yeras

This entire website is made under 5-ish hours, so expect it to be a little rough.

Though the content here might be a little useful for those who are reading.

With that being said, see you in the next blog!
